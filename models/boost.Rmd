```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(ISLR)
data(Wage)
```

## Subsets

```{r}
Wage <- subset(Wage, select = -c(logwage))
inTrain <- createDataPartition(Wage$wage, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
training <- Wage[inTrain,]
testing <- Wage[-inTrain,]
```

## Boosters

gbm - Boosting with trees

mboost - model based

ada - statistical boosting on additive logistic regression

gamBoost - boosting generalized additive models

## Fit the Model

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
modFit <- train(wage ~ ., method = "gbm", data = training, verbose = FALSE)
modFit
```

```{r}
qplot(predict(modFit, testing), wage, data = testing)
```
